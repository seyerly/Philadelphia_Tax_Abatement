Data science tools to selectively target those who we estimate qualify for tax abatement.

#### Installation
First, clone this repository locally. Next, if you do not already have jupyter notebook installed, we recommend you download Anaconda https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/, add anaconda to your path during installation, and instally jupyter notebook with the following terminal command:

`conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab`

Once you have jupyter notebook installed, run the following terminal command in the directory of the cloned repository.

`jupyter notebook`

This should open up the jupyter notebook in your default web browser. From there, click the run button to run the scripts. It should be noted that when running scripts for the first time, they will download and save dataset files in the repository folder. This will take around a minute so please be patient even if you don't see anything happening. Once you run the scripts once, the files will be saved locally and there will no longer be a delay when loading up the data.
